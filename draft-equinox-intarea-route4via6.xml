          As a result of the shortage of IPv4 addresses, installations are
          increasingly recovering IPv4 addresses from uses where they are not
          strictly necessary.  One such situation is in establishing next hops
          for IPv4 routes, replacing this use with IPv6 addresses.  This
          document describes how to provision DHCP-configured hosts with
          their routes in such a situation.

            DHCP is likely handing out individual IPv4 addresses, i.e. the
            subnet mask is /32 when this mechanism is relevant.
        </cref>
      </t>
      <t>
        <cref>
            To preempt any misunderstanding, this is an <strong>IPv4 DHCP</strong>
            option.  <strong>NOT a DHCPv6 option</strong>.
        </cref>
      </t>
      <t>
          A particularly interesting scenario enabled by the extension
          described here is the complete removal of IPv4 addresses from
          first-hop routers acting as DHCP relays, while still providing IPv4
          connectivity.  In this scenario, the relay (assumed colocated with
          the router) has no IPv4 address to use to communicate with the
          client.  An almost-working solution for this case is presented by
          <xref target="DHCPv6"/> with the <xref target="DHCP4o6"/> transport
          method.  Since this mechanism encapsulates IPv4 DHCP messages, all
          related IPv4 configuration can be carried - but notably there is no
          way to encode an IPv6 default gateway or other route.
      </t>
      <t>
          If the router and relay are not co-located, the relay may have an
          IPv4 address while the router does not.  In this case, the option
          described in this document could be carried in a plain IPv4 DHCP
          message.

      <t>
          The option described in this document is intended to be implemented
          on hosts supporting IPv4 routes with IPv6 nexthops as described
          in <xref target="v4overv6"/>.  Hosts that do not support this
          function MUST ignore the option described in this document and
          behave as before.
      </t>
      <t>
          Hosts that support <xref target="v4overv6"/> behavior and acquire
          their configuration from <xref target="DHCP"/> SHOULD implement the
          option described here.
      </t>
      <section anchor="overlap">
        <name>Overlapping routes</name>
        <t>
            <xref target="RFC3442"/> documents a mechanism to communicate a
            set of routes and their nexthops over DHCP.  The original DHCP
            "router" option (code 3) may communicate a default router.  If
            either of these options is used, the routes communicated may
            overlap.
        </t>
        <t>
            To get consistent and unsurprising behavior, this document places
            the follwing expectations on the host:
        </t>
        <ul>
          <li>
              Routes that describe distinct destination prefixes MUST be
              handled independently.  This includes routes that differ only
              in prefix length.  As a result, the routing table MAY contain
              a mix of IPv4 routes with IPv4 nexthops as well as IPv6
              nexthops.  Standard longest prefix match behavior MUST be
              observed.
          </li>
          <li>
              If routes with the same destination prefix are described both
              with previously existing methods as well as the options
              documented here, the route described by the latter MUST be used
              and the routes with IPv4 nexthops MUST be discarded.  This
              notably includes "unreachable" routes described here;  a route
              with an IPv4 nexthop for such a destination MUST still be
              discarded.
          </li>
          <li>
              Multiple routes for the same destination prefix with different
              nexthops of the same address family SHOULD be combined into a
              single route for equal-cost multipath behavior, if the host
              supports this.  If ECMP routes are not supported, the host
              MUST deterministically choose one of the routes.  This MAY
              be done by using the first or last option as seen in DHCP
              packet order, or by choosing the numerically lowest or highest
              nexthop.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section anchor="default">
        <name>Default route</name>
        <t>
            The default route is expressed here as a route for 0.0.0.0/0.
            There is no distinct special encoding for a default gateway, any
            nexthop for 0.0.0.0/0 MUST be treated as if it were a default
            gateway.

              One or more routes encoded as described below.  DHCP Servers

              It is easily possible for encoded routes and their nexthops
              to exceed the encodable size of 255 bytes.  This is addressed
              by applying the mechanism specified in
              <xref target="DHCP-LONGOPT"/>;  both clients and servers MUST
              follow the procedure described there when implementing the option

              <cref>
                  This encoding mechanism might be excessive.  The original
                  motivation was to have a way to tell the client that it
                  should use the relay's link-local address as next-hop.
                  Filling that in from the DHCP server is annoying, since the
                  server has otherwise no need to know that address.  It's
                  not a problem if the operator configures a fixed LL on all
                  routers (e.g. fe80::1), but without that each router would
                  just be using its autoconf'd LL.
              </cref>
              <cref>
                  Having an encoding for 'unreachable' routes and a shorthand
                  for link-local addresses is really just "fluff" too.
